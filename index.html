                <p>This is a Visualization of the Rock, Paper, Scissors Game showing its connections to Game Theory.</p>
                <p>You can play Rock, Paper, Scissors against a Computer player (CPU). By default the CPU chooses their move
                    randomally in a equal manner, so one of the three options is choosed one third of the time.</p>
                <p>But by pressing the
                    <strong>Settings button</strong> âš™ in the top bar, there are some settings to change up the game. The area with the
                    checkboxes determines the behavior of the CPU agent. So for each checked strategy, the CPU chooses
                    randomally one of his strategies (based on a uniform distribution probability). By default the CPU
                    chooses each round one of his strategies, but if <strong>Opponent uses only one of the checked Strategies</strong>
                    is
                    checked, it chooses one of his strategies for the hole game. With the <strong>Utility table</strong> below you can change the
                    utility values for the tuple of options used, so [Rock,Paper] could result in a different score as
                    [-1,1] respectively for each player. The rows show the options for player 1 (real person) and the
                    columns show the options for player 2 (CPU).</p>
                <p>The strategies for the CPU are the following: 
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Opponent uses random move:</strong> CPU chooses each move one third of the time.</li>
                        <li><strong>Opponent uses his Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibria:</strong> CPU chooses each move based on the given utility for the RPS tuples used (without changing the utilities it results to the same as the previous strategy).</li>
                        <li><strong>Opponent uses his moves in a certain habit:</strong> CPU uses the same move of the last round if it won, if it lost it uses the counter move to the move it was using. After a tie it chooses a random move.</li>
                        <li><strong>Opponent tries to counter common habit moves:</strong> CPU tries to counter the previous strategy. If the real player has the habit of the previous strategy, the CPU will be winning all the time (except after ties).</li>
                    </ul></p>
